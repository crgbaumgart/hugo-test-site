### About
Howdy! I'm Craig Baumgarten. I have spent the last 6 years working in San Francisco where I honed my skills as a software engineer. As of now, I am soul searching. Though technology is exciting, pays well, and is in high demand... I have come to the conclusion that the current pace of technology, when coupled with the unfettered morals of capitalism, is a dangerous predicament that nurtures an untenable societal and economic future.

With that in mind, I seek a balance between technology and its place within our economy. Selfishly speaking, I am yearn for a role that encourages technical innovation in harmony with the world's economy.

### What to Expect?
Well, I just moved to Ogden, UT in search of health, nature, and peace of mind. I plan to use the following website as a place for sharing, open thoughts, and photography.

Updates will be weekly.
